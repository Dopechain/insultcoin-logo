This should not be published to NPM. The canonical source for these are at [Dopechain](https://github.com/Dopechain/insultcoin-logos).  
See LICENSE for more info, this project is dual licensed (CC-BY for images, MIT for code)

To make your own, simply open up the PSD files with Photoshop (or Paint.NET with a plugin, which I use)
and edit the files. Try to have your layer names... make sense, for other people to also do stuff
with it i guess ok

After you finish making your changes, run "npm start" to convert the PSD files into PNG, and submit a PR on GitHub!
